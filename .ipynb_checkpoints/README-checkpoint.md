# Thesis Activated Carbon Modelling

### 1 Water treatment model USEPA
- Open-source code from USEPA that I adjusted.
- PSDM/Example_isotherm.py: Is interesting Python example about isotherm fitting (Freundlich and Langmuir). I did some changes and I can run it.
- PSDM/Example_TCE.py: Is interesting Python example of the PSDM code. I did some changes and I can run it, but not properly yet.
- PSDM/Simple_Example.ipynb: Is simple, very basic Notebook example about PSDM code.
- 1Linked_files: Article pdf that uses this USEPA PSDM model for PFAS removal on pilot scale + Excel with data from article.
- Would be interesting to check this code after I know more about what is behind the theoretical PSDM model and then I can maybe look if I can use the data from the Excel in the simulation.

### 2 Isotherm fitting
- Coded myself.
- Isotherm-fitting-Example.ipynb: fitting example using curve_fit function from Scipy.
- Isotherm-fitting-Freundlich.ipynb: same fitting method but with Freundlich isotherm.

### 3 pyGAPS isotherm fitting
- Open-source code, isotherm fitting packages.
- pyGAPS (Python General Adsorption Processing Suite) is a framework for adsorption data analysis and fitting, written in Python 3.
- 1Linked_files: link to their GitHub.

### 4 RUPTURA
- Open-source code.
- Code about simulation of breakthrough curve, mixture Ideal Adsorption Solution Theory, isotherm models... but for gas adsorption, and also but is C++ code.
- 1Linked_files: Its article pdf from this code packages. Very long and explains all kind of models and solving algorithms.
