# Thesis Activated Carbon Modelling

### 1 USEPA_PSDM
- Open-source code from USEPA: https://github.com/USEPA/Water_Treatment_Models.git
- The author did a small update in the code in December to be able to run it.
- EditMathieu is for me to change values.
- PSDM/Simple_Example.ipynb: Is simple Notebook example that runs the PSDM.
- PSDM/Example_TCE.py: Is Python example that runs the PSDM.
- PSDM/Example_isotherm.py: Is Python example with isotherm fitting (Freundlich and Langmuir), to get isotherm paramters from equilibrium data and use these parameters in the PSDM.

- 1Linked_files: Article pdf that uses this USEPA PSDM model for PFAS removal on pilot scale + Excel with data from article.
